If you are not compiling openMSX, you only need the msxpibios.rom, 
which is in share/systemroms/extensions/msxpibios.compiling

To compile, clone the openMSX fork in https://github.com/costarc/openMSX -
it contains all files neede for the MSXPi extension.

If instead you want to compile from the original openMSX project
in https://github.com/openMSX/openMSX, clone the repository and
copy all files in this directory to you local project.

You may wanto to update DeviceFactory.cc manually with the changes for
MSXPiDevice, since it may have been changed at the source by the 
openMSX community.

Compilation for windows can be done under Ubuntu (and even Ubuntu on Windows WSL):
make CROSS_COMPILE=x86_64-w64-mingw32- HOST_OS=mingw PLATFORM=win64 staticbindist=1 -j$(nproc)
