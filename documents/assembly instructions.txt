1. Solder LD117A voltage converter
2. Short/solder SMD jumpers CS,CLK,MISO,MOSI,RDY
3. Solder all resistors
4. Solder CPLD socket, EEPROM, RPI Deader, JTAG connector
5. Solder ceramic capacitors (104) and Electrolitic capacitors
6. Solder all remaining parts (headers, push button, led, diode)
7. Connect a USB-Blaster to the MSXPi JTAG connector and to a PC USB to program the CPLD:
 - Recommended to use Quartus Version 13.0 SP1
 - Open Quartus
 - Select tools -> Programmer
 - Mode should be selected already: JTAG
 - Make sure you see the USB-Blaster in the "Hardware Setup..." before proceeding
 - Click "Add File" from the left vertical menu/buttons
 - Browse tp the folder where MSXPi.pof is (should be: \hardware\CPLD_Project\MSXPi.pof) and select it
 - Tick the boxes "Program/Configure" and "Verify"
 - Click "Start" from the left Menu/Buttons.
 - Progress should move to 100% and Successful.
8. Check CPLD programming from MSX Basic:
  print inp(&h56)
  This should return the firmware version - If it returns 255, the CPLD was not programmed correctly.

Notes:
- step 2: These jumpers allow to use a different set of GPIOs on the Raspberry Pi.
- step 4: It's recommended to use a socket for the EEPROM, but not absolutely necessary. Using an EEPROM helps in case of a need to replace the EEPROM in the future.
