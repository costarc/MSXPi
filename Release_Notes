MSXPi v1.0 Build 20200822.000 Release Notes
===========================================
- Fixed bug in datatransfer retries
- Fixed bug in MSX-DOS inihrd routine
- Changes to boot messages and CALL help messages
- Added new bios.asm /bios.rom. Now EPROM Bank 1 contains only BIOS, Bank 2 contains MSX-DOS1 and BIOS. Switch using jumpers A14 (Bank1) / A15 (Bank2)


MSXPi v1.0 Release Notes
========================
This release has some major changes to the hardware and softwar components.

On the hardware side:

- Replaced the EPROM 27C256 by AT28C256 EEPROM (Electronically erasable/rewritable)
- Implemented the /wait signal on the PCB (CPLD does not drives at this time, it is always tai-state)
- Schematics was updated to supporgt the /wait signal
- CPLD logic update to drive /wait to tri-state (to avoid MSX to freeze)
- LED is driven by the SPI_CS signal (needed that CPLD pin for the /wait signal)
- Removed the jumper for the BUSDIR signal (since it is always driven by CPLD internal logic)
- Added pull-up resistors for all Raspbery Pins used in the design
- Added by-pass capacitors for all CIs.

On the software side:

- The server component was mostly rewritten to be more modular
- Every command now can be implemented in a self-contained function inside msxpi-server.py
- No changes are needed in the main loop of the program
- Main data trasnfer routine (senddatablock / receivedatablock) rewritten to allow retries and block size configuration
- Many functions removed (deprecated) resulting in a less complex and easier to maintain and expand solution
- All clients reqritten based on a simple and better communication logic
- Addition of new program AT28C256.COM to write roms to the new EEPROM in the interface

Other non functional changes includes a new design using KiCad 5 instead of Eagle, some more jumpers to support new EEPROM features.

Limitations and bugs
- To write a rom to the eeprom, you may need to specify the slot number where the MSXPi is plugged - there is not, currently, an automated and failsafe method to detect on whaat slot the epprom is connected.
- The CPLD logic and softwares are not benefiting of the /wait signal (future improvement)
- When booted from the MSX-DOS1 on Raspberry Pi disk image, the command PCOPY.COM cannot copy files from remote locations.

MSXPi v0.8.2 Release Notes
==========================


This version contains all improvements made to all software components. There are changes to the ROM, BIOS, CALL commands, MSXPi-Client and MSX-DOS commands.
The server is officially written in Python, and the C version won't be updated anymore - support will still be available.

What can be done with MSXPi
---------------------------

The MSXPi interface is fully open source, and anyone can develop more applications.
Currently available functionalities and applications:

- Update of MSX-DOS date and time at boot time
- Config RPi wifi
- Run commands on RPi and see output on MSX screen
- Access RPi sd card: list and copy files, load .roms and .bin programs.
- Access Internet: list and copy files, load .roms and .bin programs.
- Use disk images on RPi sd card and boot from them into MSX-DOS
- Play music files on RP, control volume and music loops
- Connect to IRC and chat
- Connect to WhatsApp and chat. Client allows also to register the phone on WhatsApp (experimental, do no user your main WhatsApp phone).


List of features
----------------

- Server written in Python
- Mass transfer performed by C external program, for better performance
- Online updates to all software from a http repository
- Demonstration clients for IRC and WhatsApp, functional.
- Support for both access to SD card on RPi, and remote network files - can list, copy files, run rooms
- MSX-DOS commands to use the interface
- CALL commands to use the interface from BASIC
- BASIC client with command interpreter to use the interface
- CPLD and JTAG for logic reprogramming
- EPROM socketed to allow removal for updates using an EPROM programmer
- Two 16K EPROM banks switched by jumper (can have two different ROM versions on same EPROM)
- Compatible with all RPi models
