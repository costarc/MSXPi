Known Bugs
----------

Problem: Occasionally, there might happen that some commands get out of sync. This can be identified by screen being filled with dots.
Workaround: This happens more frequently when lots of reads and writes are happening, such as when running msxpiupd.bat. Try running the command again. If RPi does not recover, then reboot RPi.

Problem: Sometimes commands returns "Communication Error".
Workaround: Run PRESET and PDIR, sometimes it recovers from the problem. If it does not, restart RPi.
