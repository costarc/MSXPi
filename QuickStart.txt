Please refer to the project’s documentation:

https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/tree/release/v0.8.2/documents

The easier way to start is to download a MSXPi SD CARD image for the Raspberry Pi, which can be found under:

https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/tree/release/v0.8.2/software/target

To prepare the Raspberry Pi from a vanilla Raspbian image, follow the README.install in the link above.

Thanks and hope you enjoy.
