These instructions are for PCBWAY.COM
The lines with "=>" are the only ones that must be changed - the others are default for PCBWAY.

The defaults will work quite well, but I recommend to change "Edge Connector" option when specifying the details for fabrication - see below.
These instructions will result in the cheapest cost (around USD5 for 5 Units)

=> Length: 99.82mm, Width: 64.11mm
==> Quantity: 10 pcs (will cost the same as 5 pcs)
Layers: 2
Material: FR-4
FR4-TG: TG 150-160
Thickness: 1.6
Min Track/Spacing: 6/6mil
Min Hole Size: 0.3mm
Solder Mask: -> choose what you like, but some places charge more for this option.
Silkscreen: White (change this color to something else if you had choose "White Solder Mask")
=> Edge connector: Yes, Bevelling: Yes - 30 Degrees
=> Surface Finish: HASL with lead (you can choose gold immersion but will be a lot more expensive)

Keep the default for all remaining options.
